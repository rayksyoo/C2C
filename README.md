This script will train a C2C model using a training dataset and creates individual connectomes for a testing set.  It requires resting-state connectomes and task-related connectomes of training samples and resting-state connectomes of testing samples.  
The script can be runned like other MATLAB function.

The script has been tested in MATLAB R2016B on Mac (Big Sur, 11.2.3) and Linux
